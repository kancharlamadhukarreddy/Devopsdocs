Note: while performing cloud automation we need to do following step after completed User( need ful ec2 policy) in IAM 
1) configure cli (aws configure)
2) configure accces keyid and serect access key id while doing AWS configure
3) write a playbook
4) We need to install boto before executing playbook by using pip install boto . ( ubunntu will give suggestions for install pip client)
